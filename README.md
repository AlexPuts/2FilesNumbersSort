# 2FilesNumbersSort
This program takes as input numbers from files "Numbers1.txt" and "Numbers2.txt", then sorts it and outputs result to "Summary.txt"
Program now uses quick sort to sort values, then it writes into .txt files.
Then it merges two sorted arrays into one file.

"Fill.c" helps to fill files "Numbers1.txt" and "Numbers2.txt" with pseudo - random numbers, the N value for "Numbers1.txt" and K value for "Numbers2.txt"
