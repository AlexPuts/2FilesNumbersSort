# 2FilesNumbersSort
This program takes as input numbers from files "Numbers1.txt" and "Numbers2.txt", then sorts it and outputs result to "Summary.txt"
Program uses selection sort to sort values inside .txt files.
Then it merges two sorted arrays into one file.

"Fill.c" helps to fill files "Numbers1.txt" and "Numbers2.txt" with pseudo - random numbers, the N value for "Numbers1.txt" and K value for "Numbers2.txt"
